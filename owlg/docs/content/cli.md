# OWLG command-line reference

`owlg` is a single command with fourteen subcommands. It turns a uint8 GeoTIFF into a
`.owlg` file with a **hard per-pixel error bound**, reads that file back, proves the
bound holds, exposes the file to GDAL/QGIS without making a copy, builds `.owlgt` web
tile pyramids, and serves them over OGC API - Tiles/Maps and WMS 1.3.0. This page
documents every subcommand and every flag, with output captured from real runs against
`samples/rgb_small.tif` (791 x 718 x 3 uint8, EPSG:32618). See also the
[Python API](python-api.md), the [JavaScript/Node API](node-api.md), and the
[project README](../README.md).

## Invoking the CLI

Installing the package puts an `owlg` executable on the path:

```
pip install owlg[full]
owlg --help
```

From a source checkout without installing, the same entry point is
`python3 -m owlg.cli` with `src/` on `PYTHONPATH`:

```
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m owlg.cli --help
```

Every example below was run through the second form from a working directory holding a
copy of `samples/rgb_small.tif`; the commands are written in the installed `owlg …` form
because the two produce identical output.

```
usage: owlg [-h] [--password PASSWORD] [--ask-password]
            {encode,decode,info,verify,diff,vrt,split,join,rebase,check,revert,serve,npy,tiles}
            ...
```

## Global options and the passphrase

These three options precede the subcommand, not follow it: `owlg -P secret info f.owlg`,
never `owlg info f.owlg -P secret`.

| Flag | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--password`, `-P` | string | none | Passphrase for an encrypted file, given inline. |
| `--ask-password`, `-A` | flag | off | Prompt for the passphrase on the terminal (`getpass`), so it never reaches the shell history or the process table. |
| `OWLG_KEY` | env var | unset | Passphrase taken from the environment. |
| `--no-color` | flag | off | Plain output. Colour is on only when stdout is a terminal; `NO_COLOR=1` also disables it and `OWLG_COLOR=always` forces it (for CI logs that render ANSI). The words never change, only the styling, so every example on this page is what a pipe or a test sees. |

Resolution order is `-P`, then `OWLG_KEY`, then `-A`; `owlg encode --encrypt` prompts
even without `-A`, because a passphrase is mandatory there. `owlg vrt` also exports the
resolved passphrase into `OWLG_KEY` for the child GDAL process.

Opening an encrypted file with no passphrase is a distinct, recognisable failure:

```
$ owlg info secret.owlg
This file is encrypted. Supply a passphrase with -P, -A, or env OWLG_KEY.
$ echo $?
1
```

```
$ OWLG_KEY='a long passphrase' owlg info secret.owlg
... header JSON elided ...
file 0.353 MB | base 0.136 | correction 0.216 | blobs 2 | encrypted True
bit-identical revert: NO - this file is near-lossless +/-2 DN
```

A wrong passphrase fails loudly rather than producing garbage pixels:

```
$ owlg -P wrong info secret.owlg
Error: wrong passphrase, or the file is corrupt
```

## Two things to get right first

**`--delta` is a hard bound, in DN, not a quality knob.** Every band value in the decoded
raster is within `±delta` of the original — not on average, not usually, but for every
single sample, and `owlg verify` proves it. `--delta 0` is lossless: the revert is
bit-identical to the source pixels. `--delta 3` means no pixel moved by more than 3 DN.
Going from 0 to 3 on the sample raster takes the file from 0.587 MB to 0.289 MB.

**`--layout` decides whether memory scales with the raster.** In the `tiled` layout (v4)
each tile is an independent blob with its own base and correction stream, plus an internal
overview pyramid, so encoding streams tile by tile and a read touches only the tiles it
needs — encode and read memory stay flat as the file grows. The `flat` layout (v3) holds
one base image for the whole raster and must decode all of it. `auto`, the default, reads
the source dimensions and picks `tiled` above 16 MPixel (`AUTO_TILED_PIXELS = 16 << 20`),
`flat` below. **For very large rasters, tiled is not an optimisation, it is the only
layout that works** — a flat 30 GB raster needs 30 GB of RAM to encode and to read.

`--recovery` exists only in the `flat` layout, and `--layout auto` therefore resolves to
`flat` whenever `--recovery` is given, whatever the raster size. Asking for both
explicitly is refused:

```
$ owlg encode rgb_small.tif out.owlg --delta 3 --recovery --layout tiled
--recovery is only available with --layout flat (in the tiled layout, --delta 0 is already bit-identical)
```

## `encode`

GeoTIFF (uint8) to `.owlg`.

| Flag | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src` | path | required | Source GeoTIFF. Must be uint8; anything else is refused. |
| `dst` | path | required | Output `.owlg`. |
| `--delta` | int | `0` | Hard per-pixel error bound in DN. `0` = lossless, revert is bit-identical. |
| `--target` | ratio | none | A size goal against the raw pixels, `20` or `20x`. The encoder searches the smallest delta on its ladder (1…32) that reaches it, prints the probes, then encodes with that delta. The ratio is the goal; the delta it lands on is the promise, written to the header like any other. |
| `--layout` | `auto`\|`tiled`\|`flat` | `auto` | Storage layout. `auto` = tiled above 16 MPixel, flat below; forced to flat by `--recovery`. |
| `--base` | `webp`\|`avif`\|`auto` | `webp` | Base-layer codec. `webp` is portable (every GDAL, Pillow, Qt and browser build decodes it); `avif` is smaller; `auto` picks per layout — see the note below. |
| `--q` | int | auto-picked | Base-layer quality. Omit it and the encoder searches a quality ladder and keeps the smallest total. |
| `--tile` | int | `512` tiled, `1024` flat | Tile edge in pixels. |
| `--no-overviews` | flag | overviews on | Skip the internal pyramid. Tiled layout only. |
| `--min-overview` | int | `256` | Stop halving once a level's longest edge is at or below this. |
| `--overview-q` | int | `50` | Base quality of the overview levels. They carry no bound (display only), so a lower quality is free; never raised above the level-0 quality. |
| `--encrypt` | flag | off | AES-256-GCM over every blob and over the header itself. |
| `--iters` | int | `600000` | PBKDF2-SHA256 iterations for the key derivation. |
| `--recovery` | flag | off | Add a recovery tier so a near-lossless file can still revert bit-identically. Flat layout only. |
| `--codec` | string | `auto` | Legacy. Flat layout only, requires `--q`, and bypasses the quality search. Prefer `--base`. |

Lossless, flat (0.57 MPixel, so `auto` chose flat):

```
$ owlg encode rgb_small.tif rgb_ll.owlg
  791x718x3 uint8  raw 1.704 MB  layout flat
    searching webp quality 1/7 q=95: 0.681 MB
    searching webp quality 2/7 q=90: 0.675 MB
    ...
    searching webp quality 7/7 q=40: 0.739 MB
  base webp q=90  base 0.132 MB + correction 0.543 MB
  -> rgb_ll.owlg: 0.676 MB  2.52x  LOSSLESS  (0.9s)
```

Lossless here is a lossy WebP base plus a correction layer bounded at zero — that is
what keeps the file portable. `--base jxl` gives a JPEG XL lossless base instead (0.587
MB on this raster) for readers that have a JXL decoder. On a terminal the quality
search is a single progress bar; piped, it is the lines above.

Near-lossless at ±3 DN. The quality ladder is searched and the smallest total wins:

```
$ owlg encode rgb_small.tif rgb.owlg --delta 3
  791x718x3 uint8  raw 1.704 MB  layout flat
    searching webp quality 1/7 q=95: 0.295 MB
    searching webp quality 2/7 q=90: 0.284 MB
    searching webp quality 3/7 q=85: 0.284 MB
    searching webp quality 4/7 q=75: 0.293 MB
    searching webp quality 5/7 q=60: 0.299 MB
    searching webp quality 6/7 q=50: 0.305 MB
    searching webp quality 7/7 q=40: 0.313 MB
  base webp q=90  base 0.132 MB + correction 0.152 MB
  -> rgb.owlg: 0.285 MB  5.98x  bound +/-3 DN  (0.7s)
```

A size goal instead of a bound. `--target 8x` asks for a file at least eight times
smaller than the raw pixels; the encoder binary-searches its delta ladder, shows each
probe, and settles on the smallest bound that gets there — the header then says
`delta: 6`, exactly as if you had typed it:

```
$ owlg encode rgb_small.tif rgb_t.owlg --target 8x
  searching the smallest delta that gives 8x vs raw (base webp)
    delta 8  q=85  -> 0.164 MB   10.4x
    delta 3  q=90  -> 0.288 MB    5.9x
    delta 5  q=85  -> 0.216 MB    7.9x
    delta 6  q=85  -> 0.195 MB    8.7x
  -> delta 6 (+/-6 DN) is the smallest bound that reaches 8x
  791x718x3 uint8  raw 1.704 MB  layout flat
  base webp q=85  base 0.106 MB + correction 0.085 MB
  -> rgb_t.owlg: 0.191 MB  8.92x  bound +/-6 DN  (0.1s)
  target 8x reached: 8.9x with a guaranteed bound of +/-6 DN
```

The search never trades the bound for the ratio silently: if even delta 32 falls
short, it says so and encodes at 32. On a drone orthophoto `--target 20x --base avif`
lands on +/-14 DN (22.5x); see the README tables.

Tiled and lossless. Note that lossless here is a lossy WebP base plus a correction
stream that pulls every sample back to exactly the original value:

```
$ owlg encode rgb_small.tif rgb_tiled.owlg --layout tiled --delta 0
  791x718x3 uint8  raw 1.704 MB  layout tiled, 512px tiles
  base webp q=90  LOSSLESS
  level 0: 4 tiles, base 0.13 MB + correction 0.54 MB
  overview 1: 396x359, 1 tile, q=50, 0.02 MB
  overview 2: 198x180, 1 tile, q=50, 0.00 MB
  -> rgb_tiled.owlg: 0.696 MB  2.45x  LOSSLESS  3 levels (1.1s)
```

The overview levels are encoded at `--overview-q` (default 50) whatever level 0 uses:
they carry no bound, so quality there is only a matter of how the zoomed-out view
looks, and 50 is indistinguishable at overview scale.

On an 18 MPixel raster `auto` selects tiled without being asked, and encoding streams
tile row by tile row:

```
$ owlg encode big.tif big.owlg --delta 2 --q 75
  4500x4000x3 uint8  tile 512px  base=webp q=75  delta=+/-2
    level 0: tile row 1/8
    ...
    level 0: tile row 8/8
  level 0: 72 tiles, base 0.40 MB + correction 3.12 MB
  overview 1: 2250x2000, 20 tiles, 0.15 MB
  overview 2: 1125x1000, 6 tiles, 0.07 MB
  overview 3: 563x500, 2 tiles, 0.03 MB
  overview 4: 282x250, 1 tile, 0.01 MB
  overview 5: 141x125, 1 tile, 0.01 MB
  -> big.owlg: 3.797 MB  14.22x  6 levels  (6.0s)
```

`--min-overview` controls where the pyramid stops. The loop halves while the *current*
level's longest edge exceeds the threshold, so the smallest level is the first one at or
below it — with `--min-overview 1024` the last level is 563 x 500, not 1125 x 1000:

```
$ owlg encode big.tif big_mo.owlg --delta 2 --q 75 --min-overview 1024
  ...
  overview 1: 2250x2000, 20 tiles, 0.15 MB
  overview 2: 1125x1000, 6 tiles, 0.07 MB
  overview 3: 563x500, 2 tiles, 0.03 MB
  -> big_mo.owlg: 3.780 MB  14.29x  4 levels  (6.0s)
```

`--no-overviews` gives a single level and a slightly smaller file, at the cost of having
nothing to read when zoomed out:

```
$ owlg encode big.tif big_noov.owlg --delta 2 --q 75 --no-overviews
  ...
  level 0: 72 tiles, base 0.40 MB + correction 3.12 MB
  -> big_noov.owlg: 3.529 MB  15.30x  1 levels  (4.0s)
```

Recovery tier — near-lossless for everyday use, with the exact residual kept alongside:

```
$ owlg encode rgb_small.tif rgb_rec.owlg --delta 3 --recovery
  791x718x3 uint8  raw 1.704 MB  layout flat
    searching webp quality 1/7 q=95: 0.295 MB
    ...
  base webp q=90  base 0.132 MB + correction 0.152 MB
  recovery tier: +0.402 MB -> revert becomes bit-identical
  -> rgb_rec.owlg: 0.687 MB  2.48x  bound +/-3 DN  (0.8s)
```

Encryption. Header, blob directory, CRS and transform are all inside the ciphertext;
only the small envelope stays readable so the file remains identifiable:

```
$ owlg -P 'a long passphrase' encode rgb_small.tif secret.owlg --delta 2 --encrypt
  ...
  -> secret.owlg: 0.351 MB  4.85x  bound +/-2 DN ENCRYPTED  (1.5s)
```

**When to use which.** Archival master, or any file that must survive a bit-exact audit:
`--delta 0`. Working copy for viewing, tiling and analysis: `--delta 2` or `3`, which is
roughly a 2x saving over lossless on this data. Both properties at once, at the cost of
size: `--delta 3 --recovery`, then `split` the recovery tier off to cold storage. Leave
`--layout` alone unless you know the raster is near the 16 MPixel boundary and you want a
predictable result. Use `--base webp` (the default) for anything you will hand to other
people, and `--base avif` only when you control every machine that will open the file.

`--base auto` resolves differently in the two layouts. In the flat layout it means
JPEG XL lossless when this machine can decode JXL (only relevant at `--delta 0`), else
WebP. In the tiled layout it means AVIF when an AVIF encode *and* decode probe both
succeed, else WebP, and it prints what it resolved to. When the codec matters to the
people who will open the file, name it explicitly.
## `decode`

`.owlg` back to GeoTIFF, with the CRS, transform, colour interpretation and tags restored.

| Flag | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src` | path | required | Input `.owlg`. |
| `dst` | path | required | Output GeoTIFF. |
| `--fast` | flag | off | Decode the base layer only and skip the correction stream. Fast, and outside the error bound. |
| `--tier` | `auto`\|`light`\|`full` | `auto` | `auto` uses the recovery tier when present; `light` stops at the near-lossless reconstruction; `full` demands a bit-identical result and fails if there is no recovery tier. |
| `--check-sha` | flag | off | Fail unless the decoded pixels hash to the SHA-256 stored at encode time. |

```
$ owlg decode rgb.owlg rgb_out.tif
-> rgb_out.tif  0.749 MB
$ owlg decode rgb.owlg rgb_fast.tif --fast
-> rgb_fast.tif  0.686 MB (base layer only, outside the bound)
```

`--check-sha` is a real gate, not a warning. On a near-lossless file the decoded pixels
are deliberately not the original pixels, so it fails, as it should:

```
$ owlg decode rgb.owlg x.tif --check-sha
Error: SHA-256 mismatch: the decoded result is not the original pixels
$ echo $?
1
```

`--tier full` on a file with no recovery tier refuses rather than silently downgrading:

```
$ owlg decode rgb.owlg x.tif --tier full
Error: this file has no recovery tier; the result cannot be bit-identical
```

On a file that does have one, `--tier full --check-sha` is the belt-and-braces
combination — it reconstructs through the recovery tier and then proves the result:

```
$ owlg decode full.owlg full.tif --tier full --check-sha
-> full.tif
$ echo $?
0
```

**When to use which.** `--fast` for a thumbnail or a quick look where the bound does not
matter. Plain `decode` for normal work. `--tier full --check-sha` when you are handing
the GeoTIFF to someone who will treat it as the original.

## `info`

A key/value sheet about the file, without decoding any pixels. Takes the global
passphrase options for encrypted files.

| Flag | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--json` | flag | off | Print the raw header JSON (minus the blob directory) and nothing else, for scripts. |

Flat (v3) files list their layers:

```
$ owlg info rgb.owlg
── rgb.owlg ────────────────────────────────────────────────
format         : OWLG v3 flat
raster         : 791 x 718 x 3 uint8  raw 1.70 MB

```

Tiled (v4) files show the pyramid level by level and whether the tile-scan digest is
stored:

```
$ owlg info rgb_tiled.owlg
── rgb_tiled.owlg ──────────────────────────────────────────
format         : OWLG v4 tiled + pyramid

level 2  198 x 180  1 x 1  0.004 MB  base only
tile digest    : stored eb33364349408284...
```

Only level 0 carries the error guarantee. The overview levels are averages of the
already-corrected data, stored base-only for display. A file produced by `rebase`
additionally shows a `vs original` line with the bound against the original GeoTIFF.

```
$ owlg info rgb.owlg --json | head -6
{
 "v": 3,
 "mode": "nearlossless",
 "w": 791,
 "h": 718,
 "bands": 3,
```

## `verify`

Compare a `.owlg` against the original GeoTIFF and prove the error bound over every
sample. Two positional arguments, `owlg` then `orig`, in that order.

For v4 files the comparison streams tile by tile and never holds the whole raster, so it
is safe on a 100 GB file; for v3 files both rasters are loaded.

```
$ owlg verify rgb.owlg rgb_small.tif
shape  : same
error  : max=3 (bound +/-3) -> BOUND PROVEN
         mean|e|=0.9965  rmse=1.4832  pixels changed=53.71%
geo    : transform same, crs same
$ echo $?
0
```

On a terminal the verdict is green, `*** VIOLATED ***` red, and a large tiled file shows
a progress bar while its tile rows stream through.

On a tiled lossless file `verify` also checks the stored tile-scan digest, which proves
two separate things: that the file really was made from *this* GeoTIFF, and — in lossless
mode — that the decode reproduces it bit for bit:

```
$ owlg verify rgb_tiled.owlg rgb_small.tif
shape  : same  (0.6 MPixel x 3 bands = 1.7 M samples checked)
error  : max=0 (bound +/-0) -> BOUND PROVEN
digest : original pixels MATCH (eb33364349408284...) -> this file really came from rgb_small.tif
         decoded pixels MATCH -> revert is bit-identical
lossless : bit-identical to the original = True
geo    : transform same, crs same
```

**`verify` exits 0 when the bound is proven and 2 when it is violated.** Pointing it at
the wrong original demonstrates both the message and the exit code:

```
$ owlg verify rgb.owlg other.tif
shape  : same
error  : max=129 (bound +/-3) -> *** VIOLATED ***
         mean|e|=3.1590  rmse=6.1369  pixels changed=58.60%
geo    : transform same, crs same
$ echo $?
2
```

That makes it usable as a CI gate with no output parsing:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/raster.yml
- name: Encode and prove the error bound
  run: |
    owlg encode data/ortho.tif build/ortho.owlg --delta 2
    owlg verify build/ortho.owlg data/ortho.tif   # exit 2 fails the job
```

Or in a shell script, distinguishing a violated bound from a broken run:

```bash
owlg verify build/ortho.owlg data/ortho.tif
case $? in
  0) echo "bound holds" ;;
  2) echo "BOUND VIOLATED - do not publish"; exit 1 ;;
  *) echo "verify could not run"; exit 1 ;;
esac
```

For a file produced by `rebase`, `verify` compares against `bound_vs_original` — the
bound relative to the original GeoTIFF — rather than the header's `delta`, which is
relative to the source `.owlg`. See [`rebase`](#rebase).

## `diff`

`verify` for any two rasters GDAL can open — the tool for measuring what *another*
lossy format did to the pixels. Give it an ECW or JPEG 2000 decoded to GeoTIFF and the
original, and it streams block by block (safe for very large rasters), reporting per band
the worst pixel, the 99.9th and 99.99th percentiles, RMSE and the share of changed
samples.

| Flag | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a` | path | required | The derived / lossy raster. |
| `b` | path | required | The original. |
| `--bound` | int | none | Exit `0` if every sample is within `±bound`, `2` otherwise. |

```
$ owlg diff d3.tif rgb_small.tif
a      : d3.tif  0.749 MB
b      : rgb_small.tif  1.746 MB, raw 1.7 MB
size   : a is 2.27x vs raw, 2.33x vs b
    comparing 1/240
    ...
    comparing 240/240
        max err  p99.9  p99.99   RMSE  changed
──────  ───────  ─────  ──────  ─────  ───────
band 1        3      3       3  1.477   53.72%
band 2        3      3       3  1.454   53.50%
band 3        3      3       3  1.518   53.91%
worst  : 3 DN in some pixel of some band (no bound is promised by this pair; that is the point)
```

With `--bound 3` the last line becomes `bound  : +/-3 -> HOLDS` and the exit code is 0;
`--bound 2` prints `*** VIOLATED ***` and exits 2.

## `vrt`

Write a small `.vrt` sidecar so that GDAL-based software — QGIS, `gdalinfo`,
`gdal_translate`, rasterio, ArcGIS — opens the `.owlg` **directly**. No GeoTIFF copy is
made; what the application reads is still the `.owlg`, one window at a time.

| Flag | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src` | path | required | Input `.owlg`. |
| `dst` | path | `<src>.vrt` | Output sidecar path. |
| `--fast` | flag | off | Sidecar reads the base layer only. |

```
$ owlg vrt rgb_tiled.owlg
…/rgb_tiled.owlg.vrt
  disk footprint: 0.696 MB (.owlg) + 4.4 kB (.vrt) — no GeoTIFF copy
  usage: export GDAL_VRT_ENABLE_PYTHON=YES  then open the .vrt in QGIS/gdalinfo
```

(The first line is the absolute path of the sidecar; the directory prefix is elided here.)

For a v4 file the internal pyramid is exposed as GDAL overviews, written as additional
sidecars next to the main one (`rgb_tiled.owlg.vrt.ov1.vrt`, `.ov2.vrt`, …), so a zoomed-out
view reads a coarse level instead of the whole raster.

The sidecar uses a VRT *derived* band with a Python pixel function, which GDAL will only
run when it is told to:

```
export GDAL_VRT_ENABLE_PYTHON=YES
export GDAL_VRT_PYTHON_TRUSTED_MODULES=owlg.vrt
gdalinfo rgb_tiled.owlg.vrt
```

Reading the metadata needs neither of those and works everywhere:

```
$ gdalinfo rgb.vrt
Driver: VRT/Virtual Raster
Size is 791, 718
...
Metadata:
  OWLG_BASE_CODEC=webp
  OWLG_BYTES=352830
  OWLG_DELTA=2
  OWLG_MODE=nearlossless
  OWLG_SOURCE=api.owlg
```

Reading *pixels* through the sidecar additionally requires that the GDAL build embeds a
working Python interpreter which can `import owlg` — set `PYTHONPATH` for that interpreter
if the package is not installed system-wide. Inside QGIS the bundled plugin configures
this itself.

## `split`

Split a file that has a recovery tier into a light `.owlg` plus a `.owlr` recovery file.
Three positional arguments; no flags.

```
$ owlg split rgb_rec.owlg light.owlg rec.owlr
-> light.owlg (0.285 MB, distribute)  +  rec.owlr (0.402 MB, archive)
```

The light half is byte-for-byte the near-lossless file you would have got from
`owlg encode --delta 3` without `--recovery`, and reports itself as such:

```
$ owlg info light.owlg
...
file 0.289 MB | base 0.136 | correction 0.151 | blobs 2 | encrypted False
bit-identical revert: NO - this file is near-lossless +/-3 DN
```

A file with no recovery tier is refused:

```
$ owlg split rgb.owlg a.owlg a.owlr
Error: this file has no recovery tier
```

## `join`

Rejoin a light `.owlg` and its `.owlr`. Three positional arguments; no flags.

```
$ owlg join light.owlg rec.owlr full.owlg
-> full.owlg (0.687 MB, revert is now bit-identical)
```

The `.owlr` records the parent's SHA-256, so pairing the wrong two files is caught rather
than producing corrupt pixels (`this recovery file does not belong to this light file`).

**When to use `split`/`join`.** This pair is the reason `--recovery` exists. Encode once
with `--delta N --recovery`, `split`, then ship the light file to the people who need to
look at the data and keep the `.owlr` in cold storage or a separate archive. The
distributed file stays small, and the exact original remains recoverable by whoever holds
both halves. `join` followed by `decode --tier full --check-sha` is the full round trip.

## `rebase`

Re-encode a file with a different base-layer codec, for example to make an AVIF-based
file readable on a machine with no AVIF decoder.

| Flag | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src` | path | required | Input `.owlg`. |
| `dst` | path | required | Output `.owlg`. |
| `--base` | `webp`\|`avif`\|`auto` | `webp` | Target base-layer codec. |
| `--delta` | int | `0` | Bound of the re-encode, measured against the decoded content of `src`, not against the original GeoTIFF. |

The correction layer is computed relative to the decoded base, so the base cannot simply
be swapped — the file is genuinely re-encoded. With `--delta 1`, the tool states the
combined guarantee explicitly:

```
$ owlg rebase rgb_avif.owlg rgb_portable.owlg --base webp --delta 1
  source: base=avif delta=+/-2
  target: base=webp delta=+/-1 against the decoded source content
  791x718x3 uint8  raw 1.704 MB  layout flat
    searching webp quality 1/7 q=95: 0.477 MB
    ...
    searching webp quality 7/7 q=40: 0.500 MB
  base webp q=90  base 0.134 MB + correction 0.326 MB
  -> rgb_portable.owlg: 0.462 MB  3.69x  bound +/-1 DN  (0.7s)
  WARNING: the guarantee vs the ORIGINAL GeoTIFF is now +/-3 DN (2 from the source + 1 from re-encoding)
```

Two details of the header are worth knowing. `delta` in a rebased file is the bound
against the *decoded source `.owlg`*; the bound against the original GeoTIFF is stored
separately as `bound_vs_original` (2 + 1 = 3 above), together with `rebased_from`
recording the source codec and delta. `owlg verify` and `owlg info` use
`bound_vs_original` when it is present, so verifying a rebased file against the original
GeoTIFF reports the combined bound and exits 0 (`owlg info` shows it as `vs original :
+/-3 DN  (rebased from avif +/-2)`). And `--delta 0` honours `--base`: the
default is a WebP base with a zero-bounded correction layer, which is bit-exact and
portable; `--base jxl` gives the smallest lossless result when the reader has JXL.

## `check`

Report what this environment can actually decode, by decoding tiny probe blobs rather
than by checking which modules import. Optionally, say whether one specific file can be
opened here.

| Flag | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src` | path | optional | An `.owlg` to test against this environment's decoders. |

```
$ owlg check
image backends : imagecodecs, pillow+avif
GeoTIFF writer : rasterio
encryption     : cryptography
numba          : present
real decode probes:
  avif : YES
  webp : YES
  jxl  : YES
$ echo $?
0
```

With a file, it names the base codec and says whether this machine can open it, and if
not, how to fix it:

```
$ owlg check rgb_avif.owlg
image backends : imagecodecs, pillow+avif
GeoTIFF writer : rasterio
encryption     : cryptography
numba          : present
real decode probes:
  avif : YES
  webp : YES
  jxl  : YES

file rgb_avif.owlg uses base avif -> CAN be opened here
```

`check` exits `0` if at least one codec decodes and `2` if none do — run it first in a
container or CI image, before blaming a file.

## `revert`

Mosaic an `.owlgt` tile pyramid back into a GeoTIFF. The output is RGB plus an alpha band.

| Flag | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src` | path | required | Input `.owlgt`. |
| `dst` | path | required | Output GeoTIFF. |
| `--zoom` | int | maximum zoom | Which pyramid level to mosaic. |
| `--t-srs` | string | none (stays EPSG:3857) | Warp the mosaic to this CRS. |

```
$ owlg revert ortho.owlgt ortho_z11.tif
-> ortho_z11.tif  crs=EPSG:3857 zoom=11 warped=False
$ owlg revert ortho.owlgt ortho_z9.tif --zoom 9
-> ortho_z9.tif  crs=EPSG:3857 zoom=9 warped=False
```

Without `--t-srs` no resampling happens at all beyond the mosaic itself, which is what you
want when the pyramid is the authoritative copy.

With `--t-srs` the mosaic is warped through rasterio (`calculate_default_transform` +
`reproject`, bilinear by default) and tagged `OWLGT_WARPED_FROM=EPSG:3857`:

```
$ owlg revert ortho.owlgt ortho_utm.tif --t-srs EPSG:32749
-> ortho_utm.tif  crs=EPSG:32749 zoom=11 warped=True
```

## `serve`

Publish one or more `.owlgt` files over OGC API - Tiles, OGC API - Maps and WMS 1.3.0. The
HTTP layer is standard library only, so it runs anywhere the package installs.

| Flag | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src` | path(s) | required | One or more `.owlgt` files. Each becomes a collection named after its filename stem. |
| `--host` | string | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. |
| `--port` | int | `8080` | Bind port. |

```
$ owlg serve ortho.owlgt --port 8977
OWLG serving 1 collections at http://127.0.0.1:8977

Every route below was requested against a running instance; the status and media type
shown are what came back.

The two tile routes are the same tile under two different coordinate conventions, and the
byte counts prove it:

```
$ curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{content_type} %{size_download}B\n' \
    'http://127.0.0.1:8977/collections/ortho/map/tiles/WebMercatorQuad/9/219/144.png'
200 image/png 90807B
$ curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{content_type} %{size_download}B\n' \
    'http://127.0.0.1:8977/xyz/ortho/9/144/219.png'
200 image/png 90807B
```

Format is chosen by extension or by the `f` query parameter; PNG is the default,
`jpeg`/`jpg` and `webp` are also encoded on the fly:

```
$ curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{content_type} %{size_download}B\n' \
    'http://127.0.0.1:8977/xyz/ortho/9/144/219.jpeg'
200 image/jpeg 14618B
```

OGC API - Maps and WMS GetMap both render an arbitrary bbox:

```
$ curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{content_type} %{size_download}B\n' \
    'http://127.0.0.1:8977/collections/ortho/map?bbox=-78.9,23.6,-76.6,25.5&width=400&height=300'
200 image/png 162942B
$ curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{content_type} %{size_download}B\n' \
    'http://127.0.0.1:8977/wms?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&LAYERS=ortho&CRS=EPSG:3857&BBOX=-8789636,2700459,-8524406,2943560&WIDTH=512&HEIGHT=512&FORMAT=image/png'
200 image/png 214443B
```

WMS 1.3.0 axis order is honoured: `CRS=EPSG:4326` is interpreted as lat,lon and `CRS=CRS:84`
as lon,lat. Unsupported operations return a proper service exception, not a stack trace:

```
$ curl -s 'http://127.0.0.1:8977/wms?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetFeatureInfo'
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ServiceExceptionReport version="1.3.0" xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/ogc"><ServiceException code="OperationNotSupported">REQUEST=getfeatureinfo</ServiceException></ServiceExceptionReport>
```

A tile outside the pyramid's zoom range is a 404 that says why:

```
$ curl -s 'http://127.0.0.1:8977/collections/ortho/map/tiles/WebMercatorQuad/4/1/1.png'
{
 "code": 404,
 "description": "zoom 4 outside 8-11"
}
```

Every response carries `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, and tiles carry
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400`. The server binds to loopback by default; pass
`--host 0.0.0.0` deliberately, and put a reverse proxy in front of it for anything public.
`serve` accepts `.owlgt` only — handing it a `.owlg` fails with `Error: not an OWLGT file`.
There is also a zero-dependency Node server with a smaller feature set; see the
[Node API](node-api.md#the-node-server).

## `npy`

Export the decoded raster as a NumPy array for ML pipelines.

| Flag | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src` | path | required | Input `.owlg`. |
| `dst` | path | required | Output file. |
| `--format` | `npy`\|`npz`\|`memmap` | `npy` | `npy` = plain array; `npz` = compressed archive with the metadata embedded; `memmap` = a `.npy` that `np.load(..., mmap_mode='r')` opens without reading it into RAM. |
| `--layout` | `CHW`\|`HWC` | `CHW` | Band-first (rasterio/PyTorch) or band-last (PIL/TensorFlow). |
| `--fast` | flag | off | Base layer only. |

```
$ owlg npy rgb.owlg rgb.npy
-> rgb.npy  shape=(3, 718, 791) layout=CHW
$ owlg npy rgb.owlg rgb.npz --format npz --layout HWC
-> rgb.npz  shape=(718, 791, 3) layout=HWC
$ owlg npy rgb.owlg rgb_mm.npy --format memmap
-> rgb_mm.npy  shape=(3, 718, 791) layout=CHW
```

`npy` and `memmap` also write a sidecar `<name>.meta.json` carrying width, height, bands,
dtype, CRS WKT, the six-element transform, nodata, delta, colour interpretation and
layout. `npz` embeds the same metadata as a `meta` entry inside the archive alongside
`image`.

The printed `shape=` follows the requested layout, so it matches what `np.load` will
report.

## `tiles`

Build an `.owlgt` web tile pyramid from an EPSG:3857 source. Child tiles may be coded as a
residual against the upsampled parent — in a slippy map the client always already holds
the parent — so the inter-level redundancy that inflates an ordinary pyramid disappears
without adding a request. The mode is chosen per tile, whichever is smaller.

| Flag | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src` | path | required | Source raster or `.owlg`. **Must already be EPSG:3857.** |
| `dst` | path | required | Output `.owlgt`. |
| `--minzoom` | int | required | Lowest zoom to build. |
| `--maxzoom` | int | required | Highest zoom to build. |
| `--profile` | `view`\|`exact` | `view` | `view` stores every tile standalone so it can be served as AVIF with no server-side decode. `exact` carries a per-pixel bound through the pyramid. |
| `--delta` | int | `3` | Per-pixel bound in DN. |
| `--q` | int | `72` | AVIF quality for the tile base. |

```
$ owlg tiles web.tif ortho.owlgt --minzoom 8 --maxzoom 11
  pyramid z8-11: 277 tiles z8:6 z9:20 z10:56 z11:195
  -> ortho.owlgt: 0.754 MB (tiles 0.747 + index 0.007)  dedup 84 tiles  (8s)
     z8: residual    0 tiles/     0.0 kB | standalone    6/    29.7 kB
     z9: residual    0 tiles/     0.0 kB | standalone   20/    84.0 kB
     z10: residual    0 tiles/     0.0 kB | standalone   56/   199.9 kB
     z11: residual    0 tiles/     0.0 kB | standalone  195/   461.2 kB
```

```
$ owlg tiles web.tif exact.owlgt --minzoom 9 --maxzoom 11 --profile exact --delta 0
  pyramid z9-11: 271 tiles z9:20 z10:56 z11:195
  -> exact.owlgt: 6.584 MB (tiles 6.577 + index 0.008)  dedup 82 tiles  (16s)
     z9: residual    0 tiles/     0.0 kB | standalone   20/   648.9 kB
     z10: residual   53 tiles/  1449.8 kB | standalone    3/   297.7 kB
     z11: residual  195 tiles/  4186.3 kB | standalone    0/     0.0 kB
```

A non-3857 source is refused up front: `Error: source must be EPSG:3857`. Reproject first.

**When to use which.** `--profile view` for anything a browser will look at: every tile is
a plain AVIF blob, so `owlg serve`, the Node server and the in-browser MapLibre/Leaflet
helpers can hand it straight to the browser with no decoding at all. `--profile exact` when
the pyramid must carry a provable bound — it is roughly 9x larger on this data, and its
tiles cannot be passed through, so serving it requires the Python decoder.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success. For `verify`, the error bound was proven; for `check`, at least one codec decodes here. |
| `1` | Any error: bad input, missing file, wrong or missing passphrase, unsupported combination of flags, SHA mismatch under `--check-sha`, `--tier full` with no recovery tier. The message is printed to stderr as `Error: …`, or as the encryption hint for a missing key. |
| `2` | `verify`: the error bound was **violated**. `check`: no image codec in this environment can decode OWLG. Also emitted by the argument parser for a usage error (unknown subcommand, missing required flag), so treat `2` as meaningful only after the command line has parsed. |
